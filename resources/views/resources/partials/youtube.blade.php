                Although I am not a web designer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfWZwsP8trUy5uHJg8gcGIQ">Mackenzie Child's</a> YouTube channel is a great place for trying to learn front-end/web-designer terminology.  Mackenzie makes some pretty sweet looking sites and has a bunch of different tutorials and video series breaking things down on the front-end.  If your a developer with some weak front-end/designer chops, this channel is great for you!
