            <p><strong><a href="https://www.scotch.io">Scotch.io</a></strong> I am very big advocate for Scotch.io. They have loads of articles and content for those trying to learn web development technologies ranging from fullstack JavaScript, PHP, Laravel, CSS, Sass, Dev Tools and much more.  A lot of the articles break down actual code in depth and show you how to implement and build projects line for line which is great for beginners learning how certain aspects of APIs work.  Scotch also just started a premium content school which gives you access to content that gives you an even deeper look at code and how to build cool stuff!</p>

            <p>I really love <strong><a href="https://wesbos.com">Wes Bos's</a></strong> approach to the web and teaching.  He has both free video series and content as well premium video series to help web-devs take their skills up to the next level.
